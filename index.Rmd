| Questions | Answsers |
|-----------|----------|
| What is a R-chunk?| It is the section where R code can be entered.|
| What is a variable?|It can be particular point of information. A column, a specific point in a table, or in mathmatics, it is the symbol for something.|
| What is a Table of Counts?| All of your data is counted up in this tool.|
| What is a data set?| It is a data set. The two words are synonmous.|
| Is datatable a function? What can you do with datatable? | Yes, it is a function. You are able to look at the data itself.|
| What is qualitative vs. quantitative?| Names, Categories, etc. vs. #'s|
| How do you use c()?| It allows me to pick my groups or variables. |
| What is the difference between:| |
| group_by and summarise| Group_by looks at a column and individuals (or variables) but you must use summarise to look at the individuals|
| select| Select looks <b>only</b> at a column|
| filter| Filter() lets me look at <b>my</b> XC career. Group_by lets me look at the summary of all runners and my XC career.|
| What is the difference between a confidence and significance level?| Confidence: 95%  Significance: 0.05|
| What is alpha ($\alpha$)? | It is our significance level i.g. 0.05 |
| What is sigma ($\sigma$)? | It is our standard deviations. |
| How does a Type I error occur?| When you reject truth or correct hypothesis.|
| How does a Type II error ($\beta$) occur?| When you reject to act or stay in the dark because you like false information better.|
| What is a test statistic?| It is a way, t-test/ANOVA/Chi-Squared, to evaluate how far the data is from my hypothesis? |
| What is a distribution?| It's where the data lands.|
| What is degrees of freedom?| Simply, it is one number less than the sample size.|
| What is a one-sample test?| I simply collect body temperature.|
| What is a two-sample test?| I look at body temperature and gender to see differences|
| What is a paired test?| I look at body temperature before and after someone does jumping jacks.|
| What is a parametric method?| A test used to find a p-value using a degree of freedom.|
| Why do we use this?| We use a parametric test to create a p-value. A p-value comes from the sampling distribution. We use a p-value to determine how far the sample data is from the hypothesis.|
| What is mu?| Mean of the population or $\mu$|
| What is a standard deviation?| Standard deviation of the population or $\sigma$|
| What is inference?| Using information, patterns, or trends from the sample to make a conclusion whether it's true for the whole population.|
| What is a Q-Q plot?| Quantile-Quantile plot or Theory vs. Actual or it helps show the distribution of data and if it is skewed or not.|
| What is a percentile? | The quartile: I'm in the 83rd quartile. It is the percentage of data at or below a given quantile.|
| What is a quantile?| My actual score: 98%|
| Can you use a histogram to verify if the data is skewed?| Yes, but it can be deceiving. So we use a Q-Q plot because there is only one Q-Q plot.|
| When do you use a boxplot or dot plot?| Boxplot is for large data. Dotplot is for small data.|
| What is cardinal, ordinal, and nominal data?| Cardinal: How many, quantitative, only counts|
| | Ordinal: Position/Order, Position of something|
| | Nominal: Name, Qualitative, Identifying feature. Nominal is a name.|
| What is a donkey and a hula-hoop?| Test statistic and distribution of statistic.|

|Wilcoxon Test: Question | Answer |
|------------|------------|
| Which style of tests can be performed with the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test? | One Sample: testing hypotheses about the center of a distribution (where the center is subtracted from each value).  
Paired Samples: testing hypotheses about the center of the distribution of differences.|
| Which style of tests can be performed with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test? | Independent Samples: test of the difference in the location of the centers of two distributions. |
| True or False. The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, also known as the Mann-Whitney Test, is the nonparametric equivalent of the Independent Samples t Test.| True|
|How is the p-value calculated in a Wilcoxon Test? | By adding up the  
probability of all the possible sums of ranks that are as extreme or more extreme than the observed sum of ranks. |

|---------------|-----------|
| What do the words "factor" and "level" mean when using R?| They refer to the column and row of a dataset. |

| What is a [variance](./NumericalSummaries.html#variance)? | A measure of the spread of data or a statistical measure of the variability in data.|
| What is the F distribution? | ANOVA's test statistic. It is also two chi squared random variables divided by their degrees of freedom |
| What are the two variances of ANOVA? | *Within groups* variance and the *between groups* variance |
| Explain what *Between Group* Variance measures. | The variablity of the sample means, $\bar{x}$, are measured.|
| Explain what *Within Group* Variance measures. | The variablity of the data within each group is measured.|
| How is the sample variance calculated? | The sum of squares is divided by the degrees of freedom. |

| What is $n_i$? | The sample size in group $i$.|
| What is $\bar{y}$? | The sample mean of all $n$ or data points.|
| Do I have to compute the mean for each $\bar{y_i}$? Why or why not?| |
| What assumptions do you have to check with ANOVA? | 1. The errors are normally distributed.  2. The variance of the errors is constant.|
| If you check one numerical responsive factor against qualitative factors, then what test do you use when checking if another quantitative factor plays a part? | |
| What so great about being able to use a two-way or block ANOVA? | A two-way or block ANOVA allows for you to check the effect several qualitative or independent factors may have on the data. |
| What is $y_{ik}$? | The data points.|
| What is $\mu_i$?| The true population mean for group i.|
| What is $\epsilon_{ik}$ ? | The error term for the $k^th$ data point of the $i^th$ group. In other words, how far that data point is from the true mean $\mu_i$. |

Evaluate the [Five Assumptions](./LinearRegression.html):

1. Linear Relation: the true regression relation between $Y$ and $X$ is linear.
2. Normal Errors: the error terms $\epsilon_i$ are normally distributed with a mean of zero.
3. Constant Variance: the variance $\sigma^2$ of the error terms is constant (the same) over all $X_i$ values.
4. Fixed X: the $X_i$ values can be considered fixed and measured without error.
5. Independent Errors: the error terms $\epsilon_i$ are independent.

##### Multiple Linear Regression

Summary

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Perform the Test
mylm <- lm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + X1:X2, data = NameOfYourDataset)
pander(summary(mylm))

# Check Your Assumptions
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(mylm, which=1:2)
plot(mylm$residuals, type = "b", main = "Residuals vs Order")
#plot(mylm, which = 1)
# qqPlot(mylm$residuals, main = "Q-Q Plot of Residuals", id = FALSE)

# Plot Regression Line
predict(mylm, data.frame(X1=X1h, X2=X2h), type="response")
myPlot(NameOfYourDataset)

```


Plot Regression Line with Base R

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(Y ~ X1, col = as.factor(X2), data = YourDataSet)
b <- mylm$coefficients
abline(b[1], b[2], col = "firebrick")
abline((b[1]+b[3]), (b[2]+b[4]), col = "royalblue3")
```

Making Predictions

```{r eval=FALSE}
predict(mylm, data.frame(X1=X1h, X2=X2h), type="response")

Here is an example:
mylm <- lm(mpg ~ hp + am + hp:am, data = mtcars)
predict(mylm, data.frame(hp = 120, am = 1), data = mtcars, type = "response")
```

##### Simple Logistic Regression Test

To perform a logistic regression:

```{r eval=FALSE}
YourObjectName <- glm(Y (Do something i.g. > 0) ~ X, data = YourDataset, family = binomial)
summary(YourObjectName)
```

Goodness of fit test with many replicated x-values:

```{r eval=FALSE}
pchisq(residual deviance, df for residual deviance, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

Goodness of fit test with few or no replicated x-values

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(ResourcesSelection)
hoslem.test(YourObjectName$y, YourObjectName$fitted)
```

To predict the probability that $Y_i = 1$ for a given x-value:

```{r eval=FALSE}
predict(YourObjectName, data.frame(ColumnName = DesiredValue), type = "response")

# Challenger Example
predict(chall.glm, data.frame(Temp=31), type='response')
```

To predict by-hand

```{r eval=FALSE}
exp(b[1]+b[2]*x)/(1+exp(b[1]+b[2]*x))
```

To find the estimated value of $e^{\beta_1}$

```{r eval=FALSE}
exp(b1)
```
